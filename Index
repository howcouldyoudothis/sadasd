The '''{{WD/EN||SCP Foundation}}''' is a collaborative writing wiki project hosted on Wikidot, running since its establishment in circa 2008. The website features a shared fictional setting of horror/sci-fi/fantasy stories called the [[SCP Universe]]; which mostly revolve around the titular [[SCP Foundation]], a top-secret organization that is responsible for capturing and containing various paranormal/supernatural phenomena unexplained by mainstream science (known as "[[anomalies]]" or "[[SCPs]]"), while also keeping their existence hidden from the rest of global human society. 

On the SCP Wiki, the majority of works consist of [[SCPs|SCP files]] (short for "Special Containment Procedures"), which are confidential reports that document an SCP object and the means of keeping it contained. The website also contains thousands of "[[Tales|Foundation Tales]]", which are short stories featuring various characters and settings in the SCP Universe. The wiki's literary works have been praised for their ability to convey horror through a quasi-scientific and academic writing style, as well as for their high standards of quality.

The SCP Wiki and Universe have inspired numerous adaptations and fan-made works in widely varying forms of media; including physically published books, short films and videos on YouTube, and even indie video games.

==Site history and community==
The SCP Foundation originated in the "paranormal" /x/ forum of {{WP|4chan}}, where the very first SCP file, [[SCP-173]], was posted by an anonymous user in 2007. Initially a stand-alone short story, many additional SCP files were created shortly after; these new SCPs copied SCP-173's style and were set within the same fictional universe. A stand-alone wiki was created in January 2008 on the EditThis wiki hosting service to display the SCP articles. The EditThis website did not have moderators, or the ability to delete articles. Members communicated through individual article talk pages and the /x/ board; the website lacked a central discussion forum. In July 2008, the SCP Wiki was transferred to its current Wikidot website after EditThis switched to a paid model.

The current Wikidot website contains numerous standard wiki features such as keyword searches and article lists. The wiki also contains a news hub, guides for writers and a central discussion forum. The wiki is moderated by staff teams; each team is responsible for a different function such as community outreach and discipline. Wikidot users are required to submit an application before they are allowed to post content. Every article on the wiki is assigned a discussion page, where members can evaluate and provide constructive criticism on submitted stories. The discussion pages are frequently used by authors to improve their stories. Members also have the ability to "upvote" articles they like and to "downvote" articles they dislike; articles that receive too many net downvotes are deleted.

Apart from the original English wiki, [[SCP Foundation Wiki/International|15 official foreign-language branches]] exist, and some of their articles have been translated into English. The [[Wanderer's Library Wiki|Wanderer's Library]] is a sister site and spin-off of the SCP Wiki. It uses the same setting as the [[SCP Universe]], but is made up of fantastical stories rather than scientific reports.
